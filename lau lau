Not from my mom. This is classically a Hawaiian dish, but once you substitute in collard greens it fits easily on any southern menu.

## Ingredients
2-3 pound boneless pork butt/shoulder
1 pound collard greens, stems removed
1 tablespoon soy sauce
1 cup water
kitchen twine and scissors

## Preparation
Rinse and pat dry pork with paper towel
Cut pork into 1-1/2 inch cubes
In large bowl, add pork and soy sauce. Toss until all the meat pieces are covered evenly.
Remove stems from larger leaves.
Place 1 - 2 chunks of seasoned pork in the center of a leaf.
Wrap the lead around the pork chunks creating a bundle. Add another leaf if necessary. Tie with twine.
Place the basket upside down in the bottom of the pressure cooker, and cover it with water (up to the top, but not past). Then place the bundles on top.
Cook in pressure cooker at high pressure for 1 hour, until falling apart.
